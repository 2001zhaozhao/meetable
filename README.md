#Meetable Frontend

This Meetable frontend is proof-of-concept. There are only a few pages and most functionality has not been added yet. This is my first time programming Vue.js and I had to spend a great deal of extra time reading the documentation to do almost everything in the UI design. I also dabbled into logic here but it was quite basic and only involved local states and no global state management. The frontend also does not connect to any backend yet.

This uses the Ionic framework so it should be easy to deploy it to Android and iOS, but I have not yet attempted to deploy it.

The main future plan for this app is to make it functional and connect to a backend. It can build off of the existing UI styling so no work is wasted.
