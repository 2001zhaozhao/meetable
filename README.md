#Meetable Frontend

Meetable is an app that will allow users in university students to connect with each other in lockdown and beyond. Every week each user can pick two interests. Based on the interests, they will assigned to one social group with 5-7 other students, where they will be able to communicate via various means (like in a Discord server). Each group will also be able to decide on fun challenges that the group members will do in a week; there will be automatic challenge suggestions as well. While the social groups will be the main way to use the app, the app will also have basic social media functionality and allow users to directly find friends.

This Meetable frontend is proof-of-concept. There are only a few pages and most functionality has not been added yet. This is my first time programming Vue.js and I had to spend a great deal of extra time reading the documentation to do almost everything in the UI design. I also dabbled into logic here but it was quite basic and only involved local states and no global state management. The frontend also does not connect to any backend yet.

This uses the Ionic framework so it should be easy to deploy it to Android and iOS, but I have not yet attempted to deploy it.

The main future plan for this app is to make it functional and connect to a backend. It can build off of the existing UI styling so no work is wasted.
